# Sasquatch-STM32WB5MMG
Arduino-compatible, USB programmable, BLE-enabled, STM32WB55-based development platform

--64 MHz Cortex M4 MCU with 1 MB flash and 256 KB SRAM for application firmware, 30 GPIOs exposed to the user;

--Robust, power-and memory-efficient Arduino core written from scratch properly handling all errata with no gaps;

--Programmable using USB via the Arduino IDE or using ST-LINK and the SWD programming header;

--Embedded RF antenna for BLE (Arduino core supports both peripheral and central roles);

--On-board 16 MB QSPI NOR flash, 3-axis accelerometer, rgb led, battery voltage monitor;

--Small (20.5 mm x 50.8 mm), ultra-low-power (~2 uA sleep) development platform for breadboarding and prototyping.
